## General

## Loops

### While Loops

These loops are used when you don't know how many times the loop should be run, just when it should end. <br>
e.g. the loop should run indefinitely until the user enters a valid input.

- Advice:
  - Don't forget to define any variables used in your conditionals before the `while` loop.
  - Don't forget to update the conditional somewhere in the while loop so that it will eventually become false.

### For Loops

These loops are used when you know the number of times the loop should run.<br>
e.g. the loop should run for each character in a string.
